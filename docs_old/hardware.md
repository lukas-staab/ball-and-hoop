## Raspberry Pis
For the project 3 Raspberry PIs Model 4 with 4 GB RAM have been used.
8 GB Flash drive probably would have been sufficient, a bit more will not hurt.
Each with one Raspberry Pi Cameras $MODEL and $CHIP. 
The Cameras are arranged like in this sketch

## Networking
A normal router has been used, where all RPis (+ your local development machine) are connected.
